This repository contains the source code, data processing scripts, and analysis notebooks developed for my **Master’s Thesis** in the *Digital Text Analysis* program at the **University of Antwerp**.

## Thesis Title
**Textual Analysis of Recruitment Strategies in LinkedIn Job Postings**

## Description
The project investigates how linguistic, structural, and emotional features in job postings influence candidate engagement. Using a large-scale LinkedIn job postings dataset (2023–2024), the research combines **computational text analysis** and **machine learning** methods to explore:

- Sentiment and tone in recruitment texts  
- Structural and linguistic complexity  
- N-gram frequency and framing strategies  
- Predictive modeling of application counts  

The results aim to provide insights for HR professionals, recruiters, and researchers by offering data-driven evidence of how job description texts affect engagement outcomes.

## Dataset
The main dataset comes from Kaggle:  
[LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset (2023–2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings)

- ~124,000 job postings  
- Includes text descriptions, industry labels, and application statistics  
- A cleaned subset (~23,000 postings) was used for modeling  

## Research Goals
1. Identify linguistic and structural factors that influence application rates.  
2. Compare linear and non-linear machine learning models for predictive power.  
3. Provide actionable insights into effective recruitment communication strategies.

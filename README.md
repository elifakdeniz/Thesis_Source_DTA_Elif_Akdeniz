This repository contains the source code, data processing scripts, and analysis notebooks developed for my Master’s Thesis in the Digital Text Analysis program at the University of Antwerp.
📌 Thesis Title
Textual Analysis of Recruitment Strategies in LinkedIn Job Postings
📖 Description
The project investigates how linguistic, structural, and emotional features in job postings influence candidate engagement. Using a large-scale LinkedIn job postings dataset (2023–2024), the research combines computational text analysis and machine learning methods to explore:
Sentiment and tone in recruitment texts
Structural and linguistic complexity
N-gram frequency and framing strategies
Predictive modeling of application counts
The results aim to contribute insights for HR professionals, recruiters, and researchers by providing data-driven evidence of how job description texts affect engagement outcomes.

📊 Dataset
The main dataset comes from Kaggle:
LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset (2023–2024)
~124,000 job postings
Includes text descriptions, industry labels, and application statistics
A cleaned working subset (~23,000 postings) was used for modeling
🎯 Research Goals
Identify linguistic and structural factors that influence application rates.
Compare linear and non-linear machine learning models for predictive power.
Provide actionable insights into effective recruitment communication strategies.
